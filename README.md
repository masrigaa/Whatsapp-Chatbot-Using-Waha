## üöÄ Overview

This repository serves as a centralized and version-controlled archive for all outputs and results generated from various [n8n](https://n8n.io/) automation workflows. Specifically, it focuses on storing data and artifacts related to our *WhatsApp Chatbot built using Waha*.

The main purpose is to provide an accessible and traceable history of workflow executions, facilitating easier review, debugging, and monitoring of the chatbot's operational performance.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Outputs are systematically organized into subdirectories, with each directory corresponding to a specific n8n workflow. A typical workflow directory may contain:

*   *Data Files*: Structured outputs in formats like JSON, CSV, etc.
*   *Logs*: Execution logs, error reports, or activity records.
*   *Reports*: Summaries, analytics, or processed data.
*   *Screenshots/Images*: Visual representations or outputs if applicable.

## üñºÔ∏è Workflow Visual Example

Below is a visual representation of an n8n workflow. While the full workflow definitions are available as JSON files, these screenshots offer a quick way to understand the workflow's logic and design at a glance.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How Outputs Are Generated

Our n8n workflows are configured to automatically push their relevant outputs directly into this repository. This integration is typically achieved using n8n's built-in Git capabilities or via custom scripts that handle the commit and push operations to this GitHub repository.

## ‚û°Ô∏è Accessing Outputs

You can easily browse all stored files directly on GitHub, or clone the repository to your local machine for offline access and analysis:

bash
git clone https://github.com/masrigaa/n8n-Whatsapp-Chatbot-Using-waha.git
cd n8n-Whatsapp-Chatbot-Using-waha


## ‚ú® Contribution & Workflow Integration Guidelines

If you are developing a new n8n workflow, or modifying an existing one, and wish for its outputs to be stored here, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1.  *Dedicated Subdirectory*: Create a unique subdirectory for your workflow within the repository.
2.  *Clear Naming Conventions*: Ensure outputs are clearly named and dated (e.g., [workflow-name]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.[ext]).
3.  *Sensitive Data Handling: Be mindful of sensitive information; ensure it is properly handled and **not* committed directly to the repository.

For any questions regarding workflow integration or repository structure, please feel free to reach out to the maintainer.
