## üìù Overview

This repository is a dedicated archive for all outputs and results generated from various [n8n](https://n8n.io/) automation workflows. It serves as a centralized, version-controlled storage for data, logs, reports, and any other artifacts produced by our automated n8n processes.

The primary goal is to ensure easy access, traceability, and historical record-keeping of workflow executions, making it simpler to review, debug, and monitor the performance of our n8n automations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Outputs are typically organized into subdirectories based on the n8n workflow that generated them. Each workflow's directory may contain:

-   **Data Files**: JSON, CSV, or other structured data outputs.
-   **Logs**: Execution logs or error reports.
-   **Reports**: Summaries or processed data.
-   **Screenshots/Images**: Visual outputs if applicable.

## üñºÔ∏è Workflow Visual Example

Below is an example of an n8n workflow's visual representation. While the JSON files contain the full workflow definition, including screenshots like this helps in quickly understanding the workflow's logic and flow.

## üöÄ How it's Used

n8n workflows are configured to push their relevant outputs directly into this repository. This is typically achieved using Git integration within n8n, or by calling a custom script that handles the commit and push operations to this GitHub repository.

## üîç Accessing Outputs

You can browse the files directly on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/masrigaa/n8n-workflow-outputs.git
cd n8n-workflow-outputs


## ‚ú® Contribution / Workflow Integration

If you're developing a new n8n workflow or modifying an existing one and want its outputs to be stored here, please ensure:

1.  A dedicated subdirectory for your workflow is created.
2.  Outputs are clearly named and dated (e.g., `[workflow-name]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.[ext]`).
3.  Sensitive information is properly handled and not committed.
