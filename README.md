## 📝 Overview

This repository is a dedicated archive for all outputs and results generated from various [n8n](https://n8n.io/) automation workflows. It serves as a centralized, version-controlled storage for data, logs, reports, and any other artifacts produced by our automated n8n processes.

The primary goal is to ensure easy access, traceability, and historical record-keeping of workflow executions, making it simpler to review, debug, and monitor the performance of our n8n automations.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Outputs are typically organized into subdirectories based on the n8n workflow that generated them. Each workflow's directory may contain:

-   **Data Files**: JSON, CSV, or other structured data outputs.
-   **Logs**: Execution logs or error reports.
-   **Reports**: Summaries or processed data.
-   **Screenshots/Images**: Visual outputs if applicable.

Example structure:


./
├── workflow-name-1/
│   ├── output_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json
│   └── log_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt
├── workflow-name-2/
│   ├── report_latest.csv
│   └── data_export_v2.json
└── README.md


## 🚀 How it's Used

n8n workflows are configured to push their relevant outputs directly into this repository. This is typically achieved using Git integration within n8n, or by calling a custom script that handles the commit and push operations to this GitHub repository.

## 🔍 Accessing Outputs

You can browse the files directly on GitHub or clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/masrigaa/n8n-workflow-outputs.git
cd n8n-workflow-outputs


## ✨ Contribution / Workflow Integration

If you're developing a new n8n workflow or modifying an existing one and want its outputs to be stored here, please ensure:

1.  A dedicated subdirectory for your workflow is created.
2.  Outputs are clearly named and dated (e.g., `[workflow-name]_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.[ext]`).
3.  Sensitive information is properly handled and not committed.
